Team Name: Py-Var
Team Members: Nick Smith, Akash Gaonkar
Project Description:
    We plan to expand to expand our compiler to handle variadic functions. These are functions that can have any number of arguments, such as sum or max in Python. We would like to research this topic because variadic functions are extremely helpful when programming. This project will give us a deeper understanding of how variadic functions work and we will better understand how they are best used.
